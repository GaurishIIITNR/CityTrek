# CityTrek

Welcome to CityTrek, a C++ project that uses graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's exploring routes and cities! CityTrek is a console-based application that helps you find routes between cities, and calculate distances, costs, and travel times. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for navigating through cities and exploring travel options.

## Features

- **View All Cities**: Check out a list of cities available in the CityTrek database.

- **View Route Map**: Explore the route map of all cities.
   - **View complete route map**: Explore the complete route map of all cities and their connections.
   - **View route map for a city**: Explore the route map of a single city and its connections.

- **Find the Shortest Path by Distance**: Discover the shortest path between two cities based on distance.

- **Find Shortest Path by Cost**: Find the cheapest route between two cities based on cost.

- **Find Shortest Path by Time**: Calculate the quickest route between two cities based on travel time.

- **Contact Us**: Get in touch with the developers for feedback or inquiries.
-  **Exit**: Exit the CityTrek program.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaurishiiitnr/CityTrek.git

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. You can use g++:
   ```bash
   g++ CityTrek.cpp -o CityTrek

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./CityTrek
## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu with various options. Select an option by entering the corresponding number. Follow the on-screen instructions to explore routes, find paths, and more.
## Example Output 
Note: All data (source, destination, distance, cost, and time) are randomly generated by me.
